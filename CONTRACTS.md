## Dev Contract

> For local development and integration tests. Data may be reset at any time.

| Component | Address |
|-----------|---------|
| **Proxy** (stable) | `0x2024eB0Cc14316fF8Cc425bFB7CC37FD8713E9b3` |
| Beacon | `0xaa77C82Dc6b4243Ff272d88619BD4f23455CCB6E` |

**Upgrade history:**

| Date | Impl | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| initial | — | Initial deploy: per-provider balance isolation, owner model |
| 2026-03-10 | `0x9a3D6C66e3e6E020D8D40d851Db76D76EBfa93f2` | Removed `msg.sender == provider` check in `settleFeesWithTEE`; TEE key signs settlement txs directly, no `PROVIDER_PRIVATE_KEY` needed |

```env
SETTLEMENT_CONTRACT=0x2024eB0Cc14316fF8Cc425bFB7CC37FD8713E9b3

## Testnet Contract

> Production testnet deployment for provider registration and real billing tests.

| Component | Address |
|-----------|---------|
| **Proxy** (stable) | `0xd7e0CD227e602FedBb93c36B1F5bf415398508a4` |
| Beacon | `0xe75F37A353EbCbAA497Ea752a6c910c9d0462382` |
| Implementation | `0x6B789e297bcC3c2F375779f1224b534A4c576445` |

**Deployed:** 2026-03-10
**Provider stake:** 100 0G (`100000000000000000000` neuron)

```env
SETTLEMENT_CONTRACT=0xd7e0CD227e602FedBb93c36B1F5bf415398508a4

## Architecture

```
User/Billing ──► BeaconProxy  (stable address, all ETH/state lives here)
                     │ reads implementation from beacon
                     ▼
               UpgradeableBeacon  (stores current impl, owned by deployer)
                     │ delegatecall
                     ▼
               SandboxServing impl  (pure logic, no state, replaceable)
```

The **proxy address never changes**. Upgrading only replaces the implementation.
Given the proxy address, beacon and impl can always be derived on-chain:

```bash
# Beacon address — ERC-1967 slot
cast storage <proxy> 0xa3f0ad74e5423aebfd80d3ef4346578335a9a72aeaee59ff6cb3582b35133d50

# Current implementation
cast call <beacon> "implementation()(address)"

# Beacon owner
cast call <beacon> "owner()(address)"
```

---

## Deploy (first time)

Deploys the full beacon-proxy stack in 3 steps:
1. SandboxServing implementation (no constructor args)
2. UpgradeableBeacon (impl, deployer)
3. BeaconProxy (beacon, initialize(providerStake))

```bash
go run ./cmd/deploy/ \
  --rpc      https://evmrpc-testnet.0g.ai \
  --key      0x<deployer-private-key> \
  --chain-id 16602 \
  --stake    0
```

Output:
```
Implementation : 0x...
Beacon         : 0x...
Proxy (stable) : 0x...   ← set this as SETTLEMENT_CONTRACT
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--rpc` | `https://evmrpc-testnet.0g.ai` | EVM RPC endpoint |
| `--key` | (required) | Deployer private key (hex, with or without 0x) |
| `--chain-id` | `16602` | Chain ID |
| `--stake` | `0` | `providerStake` passed to `initialize()` (neuron) |

---

## Upgrade

Deploys a new implementation and points the beacon at it.
**Proxy address is unchanged** — no `.env` update needed, no user re-acknowledgement required.

```bash
go run ./cmd/upgrade/ \
  --rpc      https://evmrpc-testnet.0g.ai \
  --key      0x<deployer-private-key> \
  --chain-id 16602 \
  --proxy    0x<proxy-address>
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--rpc` | `https://evmrpc-testnet.0g.ai` | EVM RPC endpoint |
| `--key` | (required) | Deployer/owner private key |
| `--chain-id` | `16602` | Chain ID |
| `--proxy` | (required*) | BeaconProxy address — beacon resolved automatically |
| `--beacon` | (required*) | UpgradeableBeacon address (alternative to `--proxy`) |

\* Provide either `--proxy` or `--beacon`.

---

## Verify

Verifies all three contracts on the block explorer.
**Only the proxy address is needed** — beacon and impl are resolved automatically from chain.

```bash
./scripts/verify-contracts.sh --proxy 0x<proxy-address>
```

---

## Provider Registration

After deploying the contract, register the service on-chain using `cmd/provider`.
See [`CLI.md`](CLI.md) for full details.

```bash
# Get TEE signer address from tapp-daemon
tapp-cli -s http://<server>:50051 get-app-key --app-id 0g-sandbox
# → Ethereum Address: 0x61beb835...

PROVIDER_KEY=0x<provider-key> go run ./cmd/provider/ init-service \
  --tee-signer <TEE-signer-address> \
  --url        http://<billing-proxy>:8080
```

Then set `PROVIDER_ADDRESS` in `.env` and fund the TEE address with 0G for gas.

---

## Design Notes

- **Proxy address never changes** — upgrading only replaces the implementation; the proxy address is the stable external-facing address
- **Open settlement** — `settleFeesWithTEE` can be called by anyone; the provider is identified by `v.provider` in the voucher, not `msg.sender`
- **Provider stake has no exit mechanism** — staked ETH cannot currently be withdrawn; `requestExit` / `withdrawStake` to be implemented
